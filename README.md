# Chuvash keyboard layout for web

There are many install packages you can use for typing in Chuvash, unless you are using Linux, where the Chuvash keyboard is already preinstalled. 
With this little javascript library you will be able to give the ability to write Chuvash (in Cyrillic and Latin) by adding the functionality to your input field (textarea, input, or why not a div with contenteditable attr).

  * `var input = document.getElementById("myInput");
     input.urapa();`

There are no dependencies with other javascript libraries.
