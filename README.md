# Chuvash keyboard layout for web

Urapa ([/uraba/](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvash_language)) is a light-weight javascript library for writing Chuvash. 

There are many install packages you can use for typing in Chuvash, unless you are using Linux, where the Chuvash keyboard is already preinstalled. 
With this little javascript library you will be able to give the ability to write Chuvash (in Cyrillic and Latin) by adding the functionality to your input field (textarea, input, or why not a div with contenteditable attr).

  * `var input = document.getElementById("myInput");
     input.urapa();`

There are no dependencies with other javascript libraries.

There are some other javascript solutions for keyboards which can be considered under the development:

  * [VirtualKeyboard](http://allanguages.info): The smartest keyboard. Supports 230 keyboard layouts, enables writing in different languages without installing the layout in OS and provides themable virtual keyboards
  * [jQuery UI virtual keyboard](http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/32615464/Virtual%20Keyboard) Only provides the visual keyboard and disables direct input into text field.
